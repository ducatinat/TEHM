DESCRIPTION
-----------

hs-backup

Automatically creates a backup of the directories specified in the configuration
(or the directory supplied as an argument with the --directory parameter,
check usage for more info)
using the windows ROBOCOPY command.

Each time a backup is complete the log is appended to the backup log file
which can be found in the hacker-scripts directory.

The log file is automatically cleared after the size exceeds 1 MB.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Here's an example configuration:

[hs-backup]
	purge            = 0
	retries          = 10
	backup_location  = D:\
	directory1       = C:\Users\Areeb\Documents\GitHub
	directory2       = C:\Users\Areeb\Desktop\Python
	directory3       = C:\Users\Areeb\Desktop\Files

1. PURGE

PURGE may have 2 values, either 0 (OFF) or 1 (ON)

If PURGE is ON then the files that do not exist in the source anymore
will be deleted from the backup location. If you prefer to keep deleted files
on your backup then set it to 0 (OFF).

2. RETRIES

This is the number of times ROBOCOPY should retry the backup if it fails.
In ROBOCOPY by default this value is 1 million (1000000), you probably would
want a lower value on a personal computer.

3. BACKUP_LOCATION

This is where all your files will be backed up to. Usually this would be another
drive.

4. DIRECTORIES

These are the directories that you want to create a backup of, each time the command 
is run.
